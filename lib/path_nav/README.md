# path_nav

path_nav is the grandfather of fractal_router.
its much like Router, but more primitive.

Weve used its parts to build fractal_router, a powerful infinite nesting router
that enables you to write powerful layered routing systems.

this code is legacy and will be removed as fractal_router matures.
